    "# Challenges for week 4\n",

    "Now that we've seen how to visualise data in Pandas, it's time for you to apply this knowledge. This week has three challenges. Make sure to give it a try and complete all of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Some important notes for the challenges:**\n",
    "1. These challenges are a warming up, and help you get ready for class. Make sure to give them a try. If you get an error message, try to troubleshoot it (using Google often helps). If all else fails, go to the next challenge (but make sure to hand it in).\n",
    "2. While we of course like when you get all the answers right, the important thing is to exercise and apply the knowledge. So we will still accept challenges that may not be complete, as long as we see enough effort *for each challenge*. This means that if one of the challenges is not delivered (not started and no attempt shown), we unfortunately will not be able to provide a full grade for that week.\n",
    "3. Delivering the challenge on time on Canvas assignment is critical, as it helps also prepare for the DA live session. Check on Canvas how to hand it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Facing issues? \n",
    "\n",
    "We are constantly monitoring the issues on the GitHub general repository (https://github.com/uva-cw-digitalanalytics/2021s2/issues) to help you out. Don't hesitate to log an issue there, explaining well what the problem is, showing the code you are using, and the error message you may be receiving. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** We are only monitoring the repository in weekdays, from 9.30 to 17.00. Issues logged after this time will most likely be answered the next day. This means you should now wait for our response before submitting a challenge :-)"

    "## Getting setup for the challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use actual Twitter data for the challenges of this week. To do so, you need:\n",
    "* To download DMI-TCAT data that you may already be collecting for yourself, or from a colleague (if you haven't requested data collection yet). Please use **the same data** that you requested sentiment analysis for\n",
    "* The sentiment analysis results (get them from SurfDrive)\n",
    "* The **retweets** file also available on SurfDrive\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have sentiment analysis results, get them from a colleague (in SurfDrive), but then make sure to download also their Twitter data from DMI-TCAT - otherwise the merge won't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges require you to already have two binary variables for the Twitter data based on the ```text``` column (created for DA3). They should be two **meaningful** categories for your data, and they should have either the value 0 (when the tweet is not of that category) or 1 (when the tweet is of that category). \n",
    "\n",
    "*You can therefore reuse the code you created for the DA3 challenges, and just continue from there. If you don't have not completed DA3, create them in this assignment*.\n",
    "\n",
